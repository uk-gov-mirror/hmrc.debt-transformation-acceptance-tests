## Running the tests

Plugins used in the ATs repo

![plugins.png](images/plugins.png)

Prior to executing the tests ensure you have:
- Installed [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)
- Installed [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Installed/configured [service manager](https://github.com/hmrc/sm2).

Run the following commands to start services locally:

You will also need a local mongodb replicaset which can be run in a docker container, to support the services' persistence.
```
    Script located in Time-to-Pay repo
    ./start-mongodb-replicaset.sh
```

```
    sm2 --start DTD_ALL -r --wait 100
```

Using the `--wait 100` argument ensures a health check is run on all the services started as part of the profile. `100` refers to the given number of seconds to wait for services to pass health checks.

Then execute the `./*.sh` scripts:

To run all debt transformation acceptance test run the below `.sh` script

`run_interest_forecasting_api_tests.sh`
`run_statement_of_liability_api_tests.sh`

To run the scalaTests on the runner

1. Right click on the src/test package
2. Select "Run > ScalaTest in 'test'...

will run the scalaTests in the runner

The tests default to the `local` environment.  For a complete list of supported param values, see:
- `src/test/resources/application.conf` for **environment**

#### Running the tests against a test environment

Running the tests against the local environment set the corresponding `host` environment property as specified under
`<env>.host.services` in the [application.conf](src/test/resources/application.conf).
